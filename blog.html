      <p>Search engine optimization or SEO in short, is a set of rules that can be followed by website (or blog) owners to optimize their websites for search engines and thus improve their search engine rankings.</p>

                 <p>In addition, it is a great way to increase the quality of your web site by making it user- friendly, faster and easier to navigate.SEO can also be considered as a framework since the whole process has a number of rules (or guidelines), a number of stages and a set of controls.</p>
<p>In simpler terms, Search Engine Optimization is a way to improve your website so that it will appear closer to the top positions in the search results of Google, Yahoo, Bing or other search engines.</p>
<p><h1>How to make the content of a website optimized well with SEO.</h1></p>
  <p>Effective content marketing is a vehicle for modern SEO.
Just as wheels without an engine leaves you pedaling, content without an SEO strategy can’t keep up in a digital marketplace. And just like an engine with no wheels, SEO without content is a shiny machine that goes nowhere.
</b></p>
<p>Content needs SEO to stand out in the din of mediocre blog posts clogging up the internet these days, and Google has said that one of the top three ranking factors for organic search is “content.”</p>
<p>But what does that mean? Not any content, surely. Unfortunately, search engines are not handing out checklists for “high-quality content,” and they probably never will. That means it’s up to those of us who geek out on this kind of thing to study search results, mine Google Analytics and create massive spreadsheets that we pretend to be bored by but secretly love — all to bring you (and ourselves, who are we kidding?) a comprehensive guide to creating “high-quality” SEO content.</p>
<h3>Step 1: SEO your content strategy</h3>
<p>Too many marketers are still waiting until the end of content creation to bring in SEO as a promotional tool. They try to figure out what they’ve just created, so they can plug in a few keywords and links.</p>
<p>But an effective content marketing strategy should start with keyword and user intent research. Once you know what queries your audience is using, and what kind of content they are looking for, you can design a content strategy that answers their specific questions and helps move them through the funnel.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Design good content</h3>
<p>Good UX is good SEO. When users are engaged, they consume more content, interact with it and share it. From the overarching structure to the details of the layout, make sure you are designing good content.<br>
There are plenty of philosophies about which characteristics make content “good” — or “sticky” or “thought leadership.” They are all worthy considerations, and every piece of content should cover at least a few:
</p>
<h3>Step 3: Create correct content</h3>
<p>Is there anything as unsettling as a typo in an otherwise great piece of content? No. There isn’t. While there is no evidence, at this time, that grammar is a ranking signal, it’s a UX/credibility concern.
Additionally, citing sources and linking to other authorities is good technique, but it’s also good SEO — those outbound links demonstrate to search engines that you know your stuff, and that you’re associating with the right crowd.
</p>
<h3>Step 4: Check your keyword usage</h3>
<p>You started with keywords and user intent research, of course, so this is not about figuring out which keywords apply to the piece of content in question. This is about examining how that keyword is being used in said content.</p>
<p>It’s true that keyword stuffing is very, very out. It was never cool in the first place, but now — thanks to Google — it’s also ineffective (if not dangerous). It’s also true that Google is very savvy about keywords. None of that, however, means that keywords are “dead.” It just means SEO needs to use them better.</p>
<h3>Bonus round: Some technical SEO content issues</h3>
<p>Technical SEO is, mostly, an entirely different conversation. Most technical SEO factors are sitewide issues that need to be audited, and the important ones cleaned up, before you start trying to optimize content.</p>
<p>There are, however, a few technical considerations relating specifically to individual content, and I would be remiss to ignore them:</p>
<p><b>Content loads quickly</b></p>
<p>Three seconds or less is what you’re working with. Make sure the images and other media files aren’t slowing down the content’s performance.</p>
<p><b>Content plays well on mobile</b></p>
<p>This will not likely be an issue if the site uses responsive design, which most do, but make sure forms and CTAs are tappable in the content, images are center-aligned and so on.</p>
<p><b>Page is included on the site’s XML sitemap</b></p>
<p>Help Google find and understand the content!</p>
<p><b>Internal links point to the content</b></p>
<p>Make sure they are relevant and they use keyword-based anchor text as possible/appropriate.</p>
<p><b>URLs are short. </b></p>
<p>Top-ranking pages have shorter URLs. Position 1 URLs average 59 characters long.</p>
